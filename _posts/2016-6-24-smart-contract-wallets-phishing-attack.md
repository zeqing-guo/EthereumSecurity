title: Smart Contract Wallets Phishing Attack
tags: [vulnerability, smart contract wallet]
---

An attack vector was discovered that affects the smart contract wallets created before the Homestead release (Frontier phase). The attack can happen if an affected wallet interacts with a malicious contract OR if the owner account of an affected wallet interacts with a malicious contract that knows the address of his wallet. An attacker can then impersonate the owner and thus can steal funds or tokens and change the owner of the wallet.
